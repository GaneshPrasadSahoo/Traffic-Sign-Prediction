# Traffic-Sign-Prediction
The Traffic-Sign-Prediction project is a machine learning application built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Streamlit. It allows users to upload an image of a traffic sign and predicts its category with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image classification and provides an interactive user interface for seamless image prediction.


Key Features:
  Deep Learning with CNN:
  The application utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to classify traffic sign images into various categories such as "Stop," "Speed Limit," "Yield," and more.
  
  Interactive User Interface:
  Built using Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive interface where users can easily upload an image and view the prediction in real time.
 Comprehensive Label Set:
The model is trained on a dataset of traffic signs and can recognize a wide range of categories, ensuring robustness and reliability.

How It Works:
1.Users upload an image of a traffic sign through the Streamlit web interface.
2.The uploaded image is displayed on the screen for verification.
3.The image is preprocessed to match the input shape required by the CNN model.
4.The pre-trained CNN model processes the image and predicts the traffic sign category.
5.The predicted label is displayed, providing insights into the traffic sign type.


Technologies Used:
Python: For building the backend and implementing machine learning.
TensorFlow/Keras: For creating and training the Convolutional Neural Network.
Streamlit: For developing the user-friendly web interface.
OpenCV & NumPy: For image preprocessing.

Applications:
Driver Assistance Systems: Helps identify and classify traffic signs for autonomous vehicles.
Education & Training: Assists in educating drivers and traffic controllers about traffic signs.
Real-World Use Cases: Can be extended to mobile or web applications for real-time traffic sign recognition.


This project showcases a practical implementation of machine learning and serves as a foundation for further exploration in computer vision and AI-based solutions.
